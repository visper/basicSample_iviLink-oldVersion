information how to create new branch

Branches are pretty easy to work with and will save you a lot of headaches, especially when working with multiple people. To create a branch and begin working in it, run these commands:

git branch mybranch
# Creates a new branch called "mybranch"
git checkout mybranch
# Makes "mybranch" the active branch

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut:

git checkout -b mybranch
# Creates a new branch called "mybranch" and makes it the active branch

To switch between branches, use git checkout.

git checkout master
# Makes "master" the active branch
git checkout mybranch
# Makes "mybranch" the active branch

Once you're finished working on your branch and are ready to combine it back into the master branch, use merge.

git checkout master
# Makes "master" the active branch
git merge mybranch
# Merges the commits from "mybranch" into "master"
git branch -d mybranch
# Deletes the "mybranch" branch
